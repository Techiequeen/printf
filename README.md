# 0x11. C - printf

his README file is for the alx printf collaboration project
Teamwork Makes the Dream Work-ALX Collaboration Project. As a team, we are writing printf functions of our own. We are to come up with our prototypes for the rest of the tasks, an example of which you will find below;

Example

_printf() is a function that performs formatted output conversion and prints data. Its prototype is the following:

int _printf(const char *format, ...)

You will find the rest of the prototypes in our "main.h" file

Below are lists of the required tasks to achieve the oblectives:

0 - Write a function that produces output according to a format.

1 - Handle the following conversion specifiers: d, i

2 - Handle the following custom conversion specifiers: b (the unsigned int argument is converted to binary)

3 - Handle the following conversion specifiers: u, o, x, X

4 - Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.

5 - Handle the following custom conversion specifier: s (prints the string).

6 - Handle the following conversion specifier: p.

7 - Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers: +, space, #.

8 - Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers: l, h. Conversion specifiers to handle: d, i, u, o, x, X.

9 - Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

10 - Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

11 - Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

12 - Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

13 - Handle the following custom conversion specifier: r (prints the reversed string).

14 - Handle the following custom conversion specifier: R (prints the rot13'ed string).

15 - All the above options work well together.
